# DeepLearningModelByNumpy

## What is that project?
Well. I think it is toy for myself to learn the deep learning algorithm. So I implement the base algorithm by Numpy.
And now, just a. dense layer has been implemented. More implementation will be updated here, such as regularization, Conv and so on.

## How to use. (   If you like. :)   )
In the Connector.py , you could see the steps to build a model in the '__main__' function.

## Bugs
The implementation of the backward in softmax may be wrong. It should be fixed first.
